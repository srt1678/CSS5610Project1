### Writeup
1. - The most challenging pieces are to implement grid features and make the website mobile friendly. Making the website responsive has always been a challenge to me. I also mostly used flex rather than grid before. So combining grid and make it responsive is extremely difficult. - 
   - HTML and CSS are not very challening as I have used them before. But there is always something new to learn or to discover.
   - Takes me about 5 days, mostly stuck on flex/grid/responsivness.
2. - The decisions I made when I made my site mobile friendly is how to properly use flex and grid. Also have to make sure the text are properly align with each other. And the width of the screen is sometimes confusing to manipulate.
3. - When I developed my website, I focusing on the alignment. Whether the text/sections/images all should be align properly. Also what would the website look like if I make it responsive: should I use flex here or grid? Should I resize the images to better fit the container? These are the questions I faced when I was working on the website. 
   - I'm most proud of my home page, I like my overall design of the page of having a banner underneath the nav bar, a profile pic, introduction; follow with education and experience. Overall I think it looks decent and organized.
4. - Want to be able to use JS and create different buttons for the user to interact with. Especially build a text box so users can leave a message or sent an email directly.
5. I spend aroud 5 days, or 30 hours on this. Mostly stuck on flex/grid/responsiveness.
